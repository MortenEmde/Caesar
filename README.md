This is a project to build a simple html dashboard of a JS code I wrote to encrypt messages in the style of "Caesar code".
Caesar code means that a message is scrambled by a key that moves the letters to the left or right in the English alphabet of 26 characters.

Example. "ABC" with a key of "2" becomes "CDE".

I have built it to be case sensitive and ignore symbols and spaces.
