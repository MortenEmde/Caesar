        <h1>Caesar Enigma Machine</h1>
        <p>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. <br> It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. <br> For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. <br> The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>
